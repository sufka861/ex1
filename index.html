                In Turkey, when you go to somebody's house, the first question isn't <b><i>if</i></b> you want to drink Turkish coffee,
                but rather <b><i>how</i></b> you would like to have your coffee prepared. To answer the question, you may say "sade"
                which means no sugar; "az seker" which means very little sugar; "orta" which means with 1-2 teaspoons of sugar;
                or "sekerli"  which means with 3-4 teaspoon sugar.
            </p>
